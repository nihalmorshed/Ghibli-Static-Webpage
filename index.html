            <h2>About Studio Ghibli</h2>
            <p>Studio Ghibli was founded in 1985 by animated film directors Isao Takahata and Hayao Miyazaki, and has
                produced twenty-two feature-length films. Most Studio Ghibli films ranked number one at the box office
                in Japan in the year in which they were released. SPIRITED AWAY, directed by Hayao Miyazaki and released
                in 2001, is the all-time highest grossing film in Japan, earning over 30 billion yen at the box office.

                Studio Ghibli films have garnered numerous awards and critical acclaim from film critics and animation
                specialists around the world. SPIRITED AWAY was awarded the Golden Bear as the Best Feature Film at the
                2002 Berlin International Film Festival and won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.
                In October 2001, Studio Ghibli, in conjunction with The Tokuma Memorial Cultural Foundation for
                Animation, founded the Ghibli Museum, Mitaka, designed by Hayao Miyazaki.</p>

            <h2>GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES</h2>
            <h3>1988 / 89 Min <br> Directed by Isao Takahata</h3>
            <p>
                As the Empire of the Sun crumbles upon itself and a rain of firebombs falls upon Japan, the final death
                march of a nation is echoed in millions of smaller tragedies. This is the story of Seita and his younger
                sister Setsuko, two children born at the wrong time, in the wrong place, and now cast adrift in a world
                that lacks not the care to shelter them, but simply the resources. Forced to fend for themselves in the
                aftermath of fires that swept entire cities from the face of the earth, their doomed struggle is both a
                tribute to the human spirit and the stuff of nightmares. Beautiful, yet at times brutal and horrifying.
                Based on the retellings of survivor Nosaka Akiyuki and directed by Iaso Takahata (co-founder, with Hayao
                Miyazaki, of Japan’s legendary Studio Ghibli), Grave of the Fireflies has been universally hailed as an
                artistic and emotional tour de force. Now digitally remastered and restored, it is one of the rare films
                that truly deserves to be called a masterpiece.

            <h2>MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO</h2>
            <h3>1988 / 88 Min<br> Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
            <p>
                From the legendary Studio Ghibli, creators of Spirited Away and Ponyo, and Academy Award®-winning*
                director Hayao Miyazaki, comes a classic tale of magic and adventure for the whole family.

                When Satsuki and her sister Mei move with their father to a new home in the countryside, they find
                country life is not as simple as it seems. They soon discover that the house and nearby woods are full
                of strange and delightful creatures, including a gigantic but gentle forest spirit called Totoro, who
                can only be seen by children. Totoro and his friends introduce the girls to a series of adventures,
                including a ride aboard the extraordinary Cat Bus, in this all-ages animated masterpiece featuring the
                voices of Tim Daly, Lea Salonga, and real-life sisters Dakota and Elle Fanning, in one of their earliest
                roles.
